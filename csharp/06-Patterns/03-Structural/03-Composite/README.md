# Composite Pattern

- Objects use other objects fields/properties/members through inheritance and coposition.

- Composition lets us make compound objects
  - E.g. a mathimatical expression composed of simple expressions; or
  - A grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes

- Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly
  - I.E., Foo and Collection>Foo> have common APIs

## Definition 

Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
