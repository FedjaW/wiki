# Abstraction vs encapsulation

- Abstraction is about creating a simple interface for complex behavior. It focuses on what's exposed.
- Encapsulation is about hiding internal state. It focuses on tucking implementation details away so no one depends on them.

Abstraction is more about reducing complexity, encapsulation is more about maintaining the integrity of system internals.
