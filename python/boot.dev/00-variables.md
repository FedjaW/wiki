# Variables

## NoneType Variables

Not all variables have a value. We can declare an "empty" variable by setting it to None.

What is None?
None is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is not the same as zero, False, or an empty string.

```
empty = None
```

The value of empty in this instance is None until we use the assignment operator, =, to give it a value.


None is NOT a specific string
Note that the NoneType is not the same as a string with a value of "None":

```
my_none = None # this is a None-type
my_none = "None" # this is a string
````

None keyword is used to define an empty (or "null" value) variable or object. In Python, the None keyword is an object, and it is a data type of the class NoneType.
