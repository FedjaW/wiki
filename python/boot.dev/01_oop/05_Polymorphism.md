# What is polymorphism?

While inheritance is the most unique trait of object-oriented languages, polymorphism is probably the most powerful. Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.

- "poly"="many"
- "morph"="form".

For example, classes in the same hierarchical tree may have methods with the same name but different behaviors.
