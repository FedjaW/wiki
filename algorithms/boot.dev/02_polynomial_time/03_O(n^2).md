# O(n^2) - Order "n squared"

`O(n^2)` grows in complexity much more rapidly. That said, for small and medium input sizes, these algorithms can still be very useful.

A common reason an algorithm falls into `O(n^2)` is by using a nested loop, where the number of iterations of each loop is equal to the number of items in the input:

```py
for person_one in persons:
    for person_two in persons:
        # every combination of people
        # will go on a date... twice!
        go_on_date(person_one, person_two)
```

## Assignment

Socialytics needs search capabilities! For now, we'll build something slow (and frankly awful) so we can see an `n^2` algorithm in practice.

Complete the `does_name_exist` function. It should loop over all of the first/last name combinations in the `first_names` and `last_names` lists. If it finds a combination that matches the full_name it should return `True`. If the full name isn't found, it should return `False` instead.

```py
def does_name_exist(first_names, last_names, full_name):
    for f in first_names:
        for l in last_names:
            if f + " " + l == full_name:
                return True
    return False
```

## Observe

When you run your completed code, notice how each successive call to does_name_exist takes quite a bit longer. Assuming the length of first_names and last_names is the same, each new name doesn't add n steps to the algorithm it adds n^2 steps.

If `does_name_exist(10 names, 10 names)` takes just `1` second to complete, then we can estimate:

- `does_name_exist(100 names, 100 names)` = `100` seconds
- `does_name_exist(1000 names, 1000 names)` = `10,000` seconds
- `does_name_exist(10000 names, 10000 names)` = `1,000,000` seconds
