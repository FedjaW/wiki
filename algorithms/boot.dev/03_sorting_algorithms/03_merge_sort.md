# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm and it's quite a bit faster than bubble sort. It's a divide and conquer algorithm.:

- Divide: divide the large problem into smaller problems, and recursively solve the smaller problems
- Conquer: Combine the results of the smaller problems to solve the large problem

In merge sort we:

- Divide the array into two (equal) halves (divide)
- Recursively sort the two halves
- Merge the two halves to form a sorted array (conquer)

## Algorithm

The algorithm consists of two separate functions, `merge_sort()` and `merge()`.

`merge_sort()` divides the input array into two halves, calls itself on each half, and then merges the two sorted halves back together in order.

The `merge()` function merges two already sorted lists back into a single sorted list. At the lowest level of recursion, the two "sorted" lists will each only have one element. Those single element lists will be merged into a sorted list of length two, and we can build from there.

In other words, all the "real" sorting happens in the `merge()` function.

### merge_sort() pseudocode

Input: `A`, an unsorted list of integers

1. If the length of `A` is less than `2`, it's already sorted so return it
2. Split the input array into two halves down the middle
3. Call `merge_sort()` twice, once on each half
4. Return the result of calling merge(`sorted_left_side`, `sorted_right_side`) on the results of the `merge_sort()` calls

### merge() pseudocode

Inputs: `A` and `B`. Two sorted lists of integers

1. Create a new `final` list of integers.
2. Set `i` and `j` equal to zero. They will be used to keep track of indexes in the input lists (`A` and `B`).
3. Use a loop to iterate over `A` and `B` at the same time. If an element in `A` is less than or equal to its respective element in `B`, add it to the final list and increment `i`. Otherwise, add the item in `B` to the final list and increment `j`.
4. After comparing all the items, there may be some items left over in either `A` or `B`. Add those extra items to the final list.
5. Return the final list.

## Implementation

```py
def merge_sort(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return nums
    mid = len(nums) // 2
    left = nums[:mid]
    right = nums[mid:]

    sorted_left = merge_sort(left)
    sorted_right = merge_sort(right)

    return merge(sorted_left, sorted_right)


def merge(first, second):
    final = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < len(first) and j < len(second):
        if first[i] <= second[j]:
            final.append(first[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            final.append(second[j])
            j += 1
    while i < len(first):
        final.append(first[i])
        i += 1
    while j < len(second):
        final.append(second[j])
        j += 1
    return final
```

Its complexity is `O(n*log(n))`. Well, at each level, the list is divided in half, resulting in a logarithmic number of levelsâ€”hence the log(n). Each level of division involves traversing and sorting the entire list, which gives us the linear part, `n`.

So combining these, we achieve a complexity of `O(n*log(n))`, efficient for sorting large lists!

### Why Merge Sort?

Pros:

- Fast: Merge sort is much faster than bubble sort. `O(n*log(n))` instead of `O(n^2)`.
- Stable: Merge sort is a stable sort which means that values with duplicate keys in the original list will be in the same order in the sorted list.

Cons:

- Memory usage: Most sorting algorithms can be performed using a single copy of the original array. Merge sort requires extra subarrays in memory.
- Recursive: Merge sort requires many recursive function calls, and in many languages (like Python), this can incur a performance penalty.
