# Selection Sort

Another sorting algorithm we never covered in-depth is called "selection sort". It's similar to bubble sort in that it works by repeatedly swapping items in a list. However, it's slightly more efficient than bubble sort because it only makes one swap per iteration.

Selection sort pseudocode:

- For each index:
  - Set `smallest_idx` to the current index
  - For each index from `smallest_idx+1` to the end of the list:
    - If the number at the inner index is smaller than the number at `smallest_idx`, set `smallest_idx to the inner index
  - Swap the number at the current index with the number at `smallest_idx`

## Implementation

```py
def selection_sort(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        smallest_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] < nums[smallest_index]:
                smallest_index = j
        nums[i], nums[smallest_index] = nums[smallest_index], nums[i] # swap
    return nums
```
