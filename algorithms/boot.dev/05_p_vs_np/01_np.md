# NP

`NP` (which stands for nondeterministic polynomial time is the set of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time, but not necessarily solved in polynomial time.

## P is in NP

Because all problems that can be solved in polynomial time can also be verified in polynomial time, all the problems in `P` are also in `NP`.

## The Oracle

A good way of thinking about problems in NP is to imagine that we have a magic oracle that gives us potential solutions to problems. Here would be our process for finding if a problem is in NP:

- Present the problem to the magic oracle
- The magic oracle gives us a potential solution
- We verify in polynomial time that the solution is correct

If we can do the verification in polynomial time, the problem is in NP, otherwise, it isn't.
