# OR

As you've probably guessed, if the logical `AND` operator is supported, the `OR` operator is probably supported as well.

```sql
SELECT product_name, quantity, shipment_status
    FROM products
    WHERE shipment_status = 'out of stock'
    OR quantity BETWEEN 10 and 100;
```

This query retrieves records where either the `shipment_status` condition `OR` the quantity condition are met.

## Order of Operations

You can group logical operations with parentheses to specify the order of operations.

```sql
(this AND that) OR the_other
```

## Assignment

The laws have changed again! Now we need to see how many affected users meet this criteria:

> Users who are from the United States or Canada, and are under 18

Write a query that retrieves the count of every user (renamed as just junior_count) that matches the conditions above

### Solution

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS junior_count
FROM users
WHERE (country_code = ('US') OR country_code = ('CA'))
    AND age < 18;
```

###  Q & A


Q: why does this not work? 

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS junior_count FROM users
WHERE (country_code = 'CA' OR 'US')
AND age < 18;
```

A: Boots

Ah, a common stumbling block for many budding SQL adventurers! Your query does not work because the logical condition (country_code = 'CA' OR 'US') is not properly structured to evaluate correctly.

The clause `country_code = 'CA' OR 'US'` essentially says, "check if the country_code is 'CA' or simply check if 'US' exists." In SQL, a standalone string like `'US'` evaluates to `true` because non-empty strings are treated as truthy. So this condition does not do what you expect.

To fix this, you need to explicitly compare `country_code` to both `CA` and `US`. Here's the corrected structure:
