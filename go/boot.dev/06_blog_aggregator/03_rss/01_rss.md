# RSS

The whole point of the `gator` program is to fetch the RSS feed of a website and store its content in a structured format in our database. That way we can display it nicely in our CLI.

RSS stands for “Really Simple Syndication” and is a way to get the latest content from a website in a structured format. It’s fairly ubiquitous on the web: __most content sites have an RSS feed__.
