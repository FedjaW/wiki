# List Feeds

We need a way to inspect all the feeds in the database.

## Assignment

Add a new `feeds` handler. It takes no arguments and prints all the feeds in the database to the console. Be sure to include:

- The name of the feed
- The URL of the feed
- The name of the user that created the feed (you might need a new SQL query)
