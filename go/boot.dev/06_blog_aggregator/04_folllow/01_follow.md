# Follow

Feeds currently have a creator (the `user_id` on the `feed` record) but there’s no way for other users to follow feeds created by other users. And because we’re making feeds unique by URL, they can’t even add a feed that another user has already added.

We need to introduce a many-to-many relationship between users and feeds. Many users can follow the same feed, and a user can follow many feeds.

We’ll use a joining table called `feed_follows` to accomplish this. Creating a `feed_follow` record indicates that a user is now following a feed. Deleting it is the same as “unfollowing” a feed.

## Assignment

1. Create a feed_follows table with a new migration. It should:

   - Have an `id` column that is a primary key.
   - Have `created_at` and `updated_at` columns.
   - Have `user_id` and `feed_id` foreign key columns. Feed follows should auto delete when a user or feed is deleted.
   - Add a unique constraint on user/feed pairs - we don’t want duplicate follow records.

2. Add a `CreateFeedFollow` query. It will be a deceptively complex SQL query. It should insert a feed follow record, but then return all the fields from the field follow as well as the names of the linked user and feed. I’ll add a tip at the bottom of this lesson if you need it.

3. Add a `follow` command. It takes a single `url` argument and creates a new feed follow record for the current user. It should print the name of the feed and the current user once the record is created (which the query we just made should support). You’ll need a query to look up feeds by URL

4. Add a `GetFeedFollowsForUser` query. It should return all the feed follows for a given user, and include the names of the feeds and user in the result.

5. Add a `following` command. It should print all the names of the feeds the current user is following.

6. Enhance the `addfeed` command. It should now automatically create a feed follow record for the current user when they add a feed.

### Tips

My `CreateFeedFollow` query started with a `WITH` clause to insert the new record:

```sql
WITH inserted_feed_follow AS (
    INSERT INTO feed_follows ...
    RETURNING *
)
```

Now that I have the new record in the `inserted_feed_follow` CTE, I can write a `SELECT` query to INNER JOIN it to the additional info I want:

```sql
SELECT
    inserted_feed_follow.*,
    feeds.name AS feed_name,
    users.name AS user_name
FROM inserted_feed_follow
INNER JOIN ...
INNER JOIN ...
```
