# Substitution Box

Substitution boxes, also known as s-boxes are a key component of many symmetric key algorithms, particularly block ciphers. The primary goal of an s-box, at least in this context, is to obscure the relationship between the key and the ciphertext. An attacker should not be able to derive information about the key from the ciphertext.
