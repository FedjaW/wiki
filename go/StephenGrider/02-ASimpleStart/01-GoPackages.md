# Packages

In Go there are two types of packages:

1. Executable and
    - Generates a file that we can run
2. Reusable
    - Code used as helpers. Good place to put reusable logic

The name of the package determines if it a executable or a reusable package. The name main will lead to an executable package. Other names will lead to an reusable package.
